# Financial Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Description
This repository contains the source files for a comprehensive and interactive **Financial Performance Dashboard** built with Power BI. The dashboard is designed to provide stakeholders with a clear, visual overview of key financial performance indicators (KPIs), enabling data-driven decision-making, trend analysis, and monitoring of operational efficiency.

## Key Features
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic charts and graphs for exploring financial data.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Focus on critical metrics such as Revenue, Net Profit, Operating Expenses, and Margin Analysis.
*   **Time-Series Analysis:** Ability to track performance over various periods (monthly, quarterly, annually).
*   **Drill-Down Capabilities:** Detailed views for deeper analysis into specific departments or categories.
*   **Clean and Intuitive Design:** Optimized for readability and quick insights.

## Technologies Used
*   **Microsoft Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling, transformation (Power Query/M), and visualization (DAX).
*   **[USER INPUT: Data Source]**: Specify the source of the data (e.g., SQL Server, Excel, CSV files, SharePoint).

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
To view and interact with the dashboard, you must have:
*   **Microsoft Power BI Desktop** (Free to download)

### Steps
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
    ```
2.  **Open the Project:** Navigate to the cloned directory and open the `.pbix` file (e.g., `Financial_Dashboard.pbix`) with Power BI Desktop.
3.  **Refresh Data (If Necessary):** If the data source is not embedded or requires a connection, you may need to update the credentials or file paths in Power Query.
    *   Go to **Home** tab -> **Transform data** -> **Data source settings**.
    *   Edit the permissions or file path to connect to your local data source.

## Usage
The dashboard is structured into several pages (e.g., Overview, Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet). Use the navigation tabs to switch between views. Utilize the slicers and filters on each page to customize the data displayed.
